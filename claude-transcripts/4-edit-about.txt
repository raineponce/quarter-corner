  - Body: Ava Yari opened Quarter Corner with a simple idea: make a place   
  where comfort food and creative practice belong together. Ava grew up     
  sketching in kitchen nooks and learning family recipes at the same table; 
  she wanted to combine those two comforts into one welcoming space.        
  (2nd paragraph) Quarter Corner is intentionally cozy — mismatched chairs, 
  warm light, and a low hum of conversation — designed as a safe,           
  unpretentious spot for anyone who wants to eat well and make things.      
  Whether you’re a quick-sketch weekender or a late-night painter, Ava      
  wanted the cafe to feel like a warm studio away from home.                
                                                                            
  Instead of the “our mission” section, have a section called “Fun Facts”   
  with the following as bullet point list                                   
  - Coin machines with art supplies                                         
  We repurposed vintage coin-op machines that accept various coins (not     
  just quarters) and dispense small art supplies like pencil leads,         
  erasers, and paintbrushes.                                                
                                                                            
  - The art wall — a whole-wall gallery                                     
  A single side of the cafe is a rotating, communal gallery where customers 
  pin sketches, doodles, and notes — a living collage that changes daily.   
                                                                            
  - Bring (and share) your supplies                                         
  Guests are encouraged to bring their own sketchbooks and tools; we also   
  keep basic supplies on hand to borrow or purchase.                        
                                                                            
  - The art-only attic — a quiet studio upstairs                            
  Upstairs is an art-only attic studio (no food allowed) with easels,       
  daylight lamps, and bookable space for longer projects and workshops.

  - Body: Ava Yari opened Quarter Corner with a simple idea: make a place   
  where comfort food and creative practice belong together. Ava grew up     
  sketching in kitchen nooks and learning family recipes at the same table; 
  she wanted to combine those two comforts into one welcoming space.        
  (2nd paragraph) Quarter Corner is intentionally cozy — mismatched chairs, 
  warm light, and a low hum of conversation — designed as a safe,           
  unpretentious spot for anyone who wants to eat well and make things.      
  Whether you’re a quick-sketch weekender or a late-night painter, Ava      
  wanted the cafe to feel like a warm studio away from home.                
                                                                            
  Instead of the “our mission” section, have a section called “Fun Facts”   
  with the following as bullet point list                                   
  - Coin machines with art supplies                                         
  We repurposed vintage coin-op machines that accept various coins (not

  A single side of the cafe is a rotating, communal gallery where customers

  - The art-only attic — a quiet studio upstairs                            
  Upstairs is an art-only attic studio (no food allowed) with easels,       
  daylight lamps, and bookable space for longer projects and workshops.
