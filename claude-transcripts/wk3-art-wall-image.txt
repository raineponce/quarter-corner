  following this description: Photorealistic angled photograph of a white   
  wall covered with many pencil sketches of various sizes and paper types   
  taped to the surface, camera shot from a 20-30° oblique angle, only the   
  nearby drawings sharply in focus with shallow depth of field, background  
  gradually blurring and a little dark as if farther from a window, warm

   tape and scotch tape details, subtle film grain, high detail, authentic  
  analog feel. no people, no hands, no text, no watermark, no logos, no

● Perfect! I've generated a 4K photorealistic image of a white wall with pencil
  sketches and saved it as art-wall.jpg in the images folder. The image
  features:
  - Angled oblique perspective (20-30°)
  - Multiple pencil sketches of varying sizes taped to the wall
  - Shallow depth of field with gradual blur
  - Warm natural sunlight from the right
  - Visible paper textures, torn edges, and tape details
  - Authentic analog film grain aesthetic

  The file has been saved at 5504x3072 resolution (8MB) and should already be
  working in your about.html since it uses the same filename. The image is ready
   to use!
