# Process Reflection

**What did you build?**
    - Using the micro-iteraton workflow, I built a toggle button for light/dark mode that was added to every page of my static website previously developed for this class.

**How did micro-iteration feel?**
    - Micro-iteration felt a little awkward at first, since I needed to stop and read through everything for each step and evaluate to see if anything seemed out of place. However, as I continued through each step, I started getting used to stopping and evaluating at each step.

**What did self-review catch?**
    - Self-review often caught color settings that needed to be set to variables for the sake of consistency across pages as well as efficiency. It also often caught issues relating to accessibility and transitions/animations, which can both be seen when I asked the AI to self-review after step 4.

**Tool impressions**
    - Since I have previously tried using Copilot Agent for a different class, I was fortunately somewhat familiar with the VS Code setup already. I enjoyed how smoothly it integrated within the code space, and I liked being able to quickly compare changes made within the code and between different files.

**Self-review patterns**
    - Yes, the AI did consistently catch certain issue types, specifically relating to accessibility and transitions/animations, as previously mentioned. Additionally, it needed to repeatedly fix settings related to animations since the animations kept firing at times that might not appear nice to the user.

**Browser tools vs. CLI comparison**
    - Overall, I enjoyed working with either the Claude Code CLI or Copilot Agent, though the CLI experience was a little bumpy for me at first due to setup issues (since my account on my computer is not an admin account), but once I got set up with either tool, the iterative prompt/answer workflow was fairly similar.

**When would you use micro-iteration + self-review?**
    - I would use micro-iteration for working on a specific or more unique feature that I would like to understand in greater depth. Micro-iteration could also be used if I want to learn more about the inner workings of a feature or make sure the feature is effectively tested. I would skip this workflow for features I am familiar with, or with initial boilerplate file setup that follows common, established patterns.
